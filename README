Experimental CSS (ExCSS)

--------
is a CSS desugarer written in javascript, included as a <script> or <link> tag,
which transparently transforms markup of type "text/excss" into "text/css", and
provides a javascript API for features such as variable changing.

--------
Tests

ExCSS is bundled with a test suite, doubling as examples for how to use it.
These are located in tests/style ("style" indicating that ExCSS inclusion via a
<style> tag is being tested; there are also "link" tests generated automatically
from the style tests).

--------
Test harness

The tests are just a simple html page, tests/tests.html.  These can be run via
a browser (file://...) but due to ExCSS' use of XHR should be accessed via a
webserver.  A simple webserver written in node.js is bundled; to use it, run

  node server.js [port]

and follow the instructions.
Before running the tests, ensure that the "link" tests exist by running

  tests/makeLinkTests
